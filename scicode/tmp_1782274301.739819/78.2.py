# Background: The forced, damped single pendulum is governed by a second-order nonlinear
# differential equation. The equation of motion combines three main forces:
# 1. Restoring force: -g/L * sin(theta) (gravitational component)
# 2. Damping force: -beta * omega (proportional to angular velocity)
# 3. Driving force: A * cos(alpha * t) (external periodic forcing)
# 
# The system is described by:
# d²θ/dt² = -(g/L)*sin(θ) - β*(dθ/dt) + (A/L)*cos(α*t)
#
# To solve this second-order ODE numerically, we convert it to a system of
# two first-order ODEs by defining the state vector y = [θ, ω]^T where:
# θ is the angular displacement (radians)
# ω is the angular velocity (radians/second)
#
# The system becomes:
# dθ/dt = ω
# dω/dt = -(g/L)*sin(θ) - β*ω + (A/L)*cos(α*t)
#
# This allows numerical integration using standard ODE solvers like scipy.integrate.odeint.

# Background: The Runge-Kutta 4th-order (RK4) method is a widely-used explicit numerical
# integration scheme for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Given an ODE of the form:
# dy/dt = f(y, t), the RK4 method approximates the solution by computing a weighted average of
# four slope estimates (k1, k2, k3, k4) at different points within a time step.
#
# The RK4 algorithm for a single step from time t to t+dt is:
# k1 = f(y, t)                              [slope at the beginning]
# k2 = f(y + (dt/2)*k1, t + dt/2)           [slope at midpoint, using k1]
# k3 = f(y + (dt/2)*k2, t + dt/2)           [slope at midpoint, using k2]
# k4 = f(y + dt*k3, t + dt)                 [slope at the end, using k3]
# y_new = y + (dt/6) * (k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4)
#
# The weights (1, 2, 2, 1) and division by 6 give a fourth-order accurate approximation,
# meaning the local truncation error is O(dt^5) and the global error is O(dt^4).
# This method is particularly effective for smooth problems and provides good accuracy
# with moderate computational cost.
